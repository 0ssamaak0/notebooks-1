        "# Migrating Monolithic Prompts to Command-R with RAG\n",
        "\n",
        "Command-R is a powerful LLM optimized for long context tasks such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Migrating a monolithic task such as question-answering or query-focused summarization to RAG can improve the quality of responses due to reduced hallucination and improved conciseness through grounding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Previously, migrating an existing use case to RAG involved a lot of manual work around indexing documents, implementing at least a basic search strategy, extensive post-processing to introduce proper grounding through citations, and of course fine-tuning an LLM to work well in the RAG paradigm.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cookbook demonstrates automatic migration of monolithic prompts through two diverse use cases where an original prompt is broken down into two parts: (1) context; and (2) instructions. The former can be done automatically or through simple chunking, while the latter is done automatically by Command-R through single shot prompt optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two use cases demonstrated here are:\n",
