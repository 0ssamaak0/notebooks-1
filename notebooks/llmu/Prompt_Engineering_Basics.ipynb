    "Prompting is at the heart of working with LLMs. The prompt provides context for the text that we want the model to generate. The prompts we create can be anything from simple instructions to more complex pieces of text, and they are used to encourage the model to produce a specific type of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming up with a good prompt is a bit of both science and art. On the one hand, we know the broad patterns that enable us to construct a prompt that will generate the output that we want. But on the other hand, there is so much room for creativity and imagination.\n",

Text embedding returns a list of numbers representing the semantic meaning of the input text, useful for sentiment analysis and other applications. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Q: How does text embedding work, and what is its utility?**\n",
