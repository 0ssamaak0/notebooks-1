    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "It's worth spending some time learning the various hyperparameters of the generation endpoint. Parameters like [temperature](https://docs.cohere.ai/temperature-wiki), for example, which tunes the degree of randomness in the generations. Other parameters include `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` which can reduce the amount of repetition in the output of the model. See the [API reference of the generate endpoint](https://docs.cohere.ai/generate-reference) for more details on all the parameters."
